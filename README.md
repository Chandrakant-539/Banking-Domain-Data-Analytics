# Banking-Domain-Data-Analytics
Project Overview
This project analyzes a Portuguese banking institutionâ€™s direct marketing campaign data using Python and data visualization tools. The objective was to determine what factors influence whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit, based on their demographic and campaign response data.
